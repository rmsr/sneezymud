These are now kept in the mobresponses table.

These files contain scripts run by mobs in response to things the players say
or do (or give them). They are mainly how quests are run (spread out through
all the mobs' scripts - massive spaghetti code)

These are referenced in just two places, and are basically unused:

cmd_sedit.cc: 'sedit' command manipulates the response file contents in an
intelligent fashion. However, it's from 1999, probably incomplete, and only
works if you're damescena or lapsos anyway.

cmd_show.cc: 'show' command, when used on a spell component and NOT in prod
mode, grovels through all the response files looking for load cmds.
